Cross Site Scripting
Xss is a type of security vulnerability typically found i web applications.
XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages used by other users.
images can be sent, even cookie can be retrieved by the hacker.
for example in the Yelpcamp, if we add a new campground,
title: Caesgo <script>alert("hahaha attacked")</script>
this would actually run an alert. but this must not happen obviously.
